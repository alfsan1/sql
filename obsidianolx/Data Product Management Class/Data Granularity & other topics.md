## Data Granularity
 Increased [data granularity] can lead to fast and actionable insights making your marketing significantly more efficient and effective 
  the definition of [data granularity] is that it's the deep the level of detail of the information that is acquired, the more attributes or specifications it has. 
  From the class: [data granularity] concerns what is being measured by a given dataset

From link: Detailed information that can inform immediate action is far more valuable than this broad-spectrum approach—especially in pharmaceutical marketing. Increased data granularity that leads to immediately actionable insights makes your marketing more efficient and effective.

## What is [Data Granularity]?

[Data granularity] is the level of detail considered in a model or decision making process or represented in an analysis report. The greater the granularity, the deeper the level of detail. Increased granularity can help you drill down on the details of each marketing channel and assess its efficacy, efficiency, and overall ROI.

"Increased granularity can help you examine each brand’s performance and make specific, targeted adjustments to discrete variables to improve sales and profitability."

regarding data: 

[Primary Key] is the unique identifier for a row/column in a data set, it can be composite, like two unique identifiers. We saw the excercise of the susbscription / suscriber ID. 

## Data Distribution
-   **Standard deviation** - the measure of how dispersed (wide) a dataset is
-   **One standard deviation from the mean** - 68% of all values fall by this range both below and above the mean
-   **Two standard deviations from the mean** - 95% of all values fall by this range both below and above the mean
-   **Median** - Midpoint of a frequency distribution
-   **Average** - Also known as mean, the value of the central point in a dataset based on the weight of other values
-   **Long-tail distribution** - When a distribution has a large number of occurrences that are relatively far from the median of the distribution


**Key Term**

**Definition**

Granularity

What exactly is being measured in the dataset; what each row represents

Distribution

How spread apart the data is, and where the center of the data lies in terms of both the weight numerical values, and the raw number of data points

Modeling

How the data is spread across multiple tables, and how is the data aggregated (or pre-counted) for query efficiency?

Primary key

Unique value of each row in a dataset

Standard deviation

The measure of how dispersed (wide) a dataset is

One standard deviation from the mean

68% of all values fall by this range both below and above the mean

Two standard deviation from the mean

95% of all values fall by this range both below and above the mean

Median

Midpoint of a frequency distribution

Average

Also known as mean, the value of the central point in a dataset based on the weight other values

Long tail distribution

When a distribution has a large number of occurrences that are relatively far from the median of the distribution

Aggregate

Data pre-counted together in a table, for query performance & end-user efficiency

Fact table

Contains what is being measured

Dimensional table

Contains information or metadata about a particular slice of data

** views on data **
Box plots are good for quickly visualizing the spread of data, its median, its clusters, its outliers, and its total range.

Histograms are good for visualizing distributions of continuous variables.

Bar charts are similar to histograms, but instead are good for visualizing comparisons of discrete variables.

---
there are different types of visualization and tableau is key for this. the course in udacity for #tableau is the course i should take next. 



types of graphs

Key Term

Definition

Line graph

Visualization is most effective for displaying time-series trends

Donut chart

Visualization is most effective for comparing dimensions of low-cardinality values

Choropleth map

Display the frequency of geospatial point data on a discrete scale, based on what boundary you specify

Density map

Display the frequency of geospatial point data on a continuous scale

Box plot

Visualization is effective at displaying the spread of data, its clusters, its outliers, and its range.

Histogram

Visualization is effective at comparing bins (or ranges) of continuous variables.

Bar chart

Visualization is effective at comparing discrete variables.
